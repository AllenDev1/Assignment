step 1: Open the crontab editor by running the command "crontab -e".
step 2: In the editor, add a new line with the following content: "30 2 * * * /var/script/backup.sh". This tells the cron daemon to run the /var/script/backup.sh script at 2:30 AM (30 minutes past 2 AM) every day.
step 3: Save and close the crontab file.
